# Elastic Search for Vagrant 2.x
A vagrant box for testing the Joomla Elastic search component (https://github.com/wilsonge/jes). Runs on port 9200 with an index created of `joomla`

To use this project, simply clone the repo navigate into it and run `vagrant up` (assuming you already have vagrant installed). If you do not have vagrant installed there are many great tutorials that can be found on google that can help you much better than me!! :)
